# UX Process

This is my usual design workflow which starts from conceptualization to creating prototype or ux research (usability testing). 

## Conceptualization & Analysis

This is the very foundation of every design process. It is were we ask the right questions from our stakeholders, and collaborate with our design team.

**1. Asking the RIGHT questions**
* Who are the target audience / users?
* What is the product’s user goals? (i.e. sign up, buy, share)
* What are the business’ goals?
* What are the user problems we are trying to solve?

**2. Team Collaboration Session or Solution Creation**

* How might we (HMW)

  It is a technique for brainstorming where we practice writing open-ended questions to spark ideas. Like,  How might we... create a system where user can login without typing their email address and password, create a cone for ice cream without dripping etc.  

   _"The goal is to find opportunities for design, so if your insights suggest several How Might We questions that’s great.”_

* Crazy 8 or 6ups 
  1. Designers will be given a feature to think of and create a low fidelity wireframe from it, using the 6ups template   given (to be done in 10 minutes). 
  2. After 10 minutes, designer explain their work in the group, then draws another 6ups to create more solutions. 
  3. Designers will post their solutions and reflect about them.
  4. Each participant will pick an idea which they want to flesh out more, and do it in a 1 up template. And create a detailed wireframe for 5 minutes.
  5. Now, designers explain their 1 up template to the team, and proceed with a dot votation of which design to implement. (Final designs can also be a mix and match of other designer’s work)

* Design Critique
    
    A strategy where designers' work are being critiqued by other designers through “Socratic Questioning” or posing questions to pass judgement.

## Wireframes

  In creating wireframes, I usually create low fidelity wireframes in pen and paper, but when doing digital wireframes, Balsamiq and UXflow is what I use.
  
  * Balsamiq is a tool where you can roughly create wireframes which costs $89

  * UX flow a wireframing tool which can be used in Sketch app, Figma, and Adobe XD which costs from $49 - $69

## Mockups

  Mockups are usually the end product of a design project. I'm using design software Sketch (if project can be done by one designer) and Figma (for collaborative designing). I'm using a design system in creating mock ups which you can check here -- [design-style-guide.md](https://github.com/rielm/design-resources/blob/master/design-style-guide.md)
  
  * Sketch app for $99 one time payment
  
    - Tools: [Sketch app](https://www.sketchapp.com/)
    
  * Figma from $0 to $12/user/mo
  
    - Tools: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
  
## Prototype
  
  Protytpe is an early sample of the design without it having coded or developed. Usually, I create prototypes for my clients to see how the app's workflow and interaction will be. I'm using Flinto to create animated prototypes, and Invision for UX workflow prototype
  
  * Flinto for $20/mo
  
    - Tools: [Flinto](https://www.flinto.com/)
    
  * Invision from $0 to $99/mo
  
    - Tools: [Invisionapp](https://www.invisionapp.com/)
 
   
## UX Research (Usability testing) 

  This process can be done before creating mockups or after prototyping. At most times, usability testing leads to iteration, where you revise and make changes to your wireframes or mockups to satisfy user's experience based from testing results.
