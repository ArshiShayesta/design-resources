## Sketch Wokflow

###Grid configuration:

I set my grid to 8x8 pixels since most of all screen sizes are divisible by 8.

  **_Article: [Grid system](https://builttoadapt.io/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-d2573cde8632)_**

###Base page

Then, I start with creating a one base page, which will serve as my reference or guide for my other pages. Usually, my base pages are homepages.

###Symbols

From the base page, I extract the elements used to Symbols. I create the following symbols with their corresponding layer names:

  * Colors
  
    - Branding Primary: setting the branding colors and adding them to "documented colors"
    
      (color / primary / brand-color)
      
    - Black: 75%, 50%, 25% 
    
      (color / black / 75 ; color / black / 50 ; color / black / 25)
      
    - Gray: 3-5 different shades of gray, mostly used as dividers and shape stokes 
    
      (color / gray / dark , color / gray / light etc)
    
    - Accent: Warning, Danger, Success
    
      (color / accent / warning , color / accent / danger , color / accent / success)
      
      
  * Buttons
      
    - Primary buttons
    
      (button / primary / big etc)
    
    - Outline buttons
    
  * States
  
    - Hover state
    
      (state / hover)
      
    - Disabled state
    
      (state / disabled)
      
    - Pressed state
      
      (state / pressed)

   * Icons 
   
      (icon / icon-name)
      
      
   * Typography
   
      My base font is usually 16px and I multiply it to 1.414 to get its modular scale then plot down all the font sizes on my artboard with the following text style names:
      
      - Display 1
      - Display 2
      - Display 3
      - Display 4
      - Headline
      - Title
      - Subheading
      
      - Body 2
      - Body 1
      - Button
      - Links

###Design style guide

I group my layers and rename the group with its composition name. Read [Design style guide](https://github.com/rielm/design-resources/blob/master/design-style-guide.md) to know more about my design style guide. 

###First design run to final run

Once I've laid out all my symbols, texts, and pages, I now create the final sketch document. I only get the symbols and styles which I have used in my first run of design and move it in my design final run.

###Design polish

After doing the design final run, I do some polishing especially if my elements, components are following the 8x8 grid system. Checking my spacing, font sizes, and color consitency.
