## Sketch Wokflow

### Grid configuration:

I set my grid to 8x8 pixels since most of all screen sizes are divisible by 8.

### Base page

Then, I start with creating a one base page, which will serve as my reference or guide for my other pages. Usually, my base page is homepage.

### Symbols

From the base page, I extract the elements used to Symbols (i.e. buttons, colors, icons, etc). I create the following symbols with their corresponding layer names:

  * Colors
  
    - Branding Primary: setting the branding colors and adding them to "documented colors"
    
      (color / primary / brand-color)
      
    - Black: 75%, 50%, 25% 
    
      (color / black / 75 etc.)
      
    - Gray: 3-5 different shades of gray, mostly used as dividers and shape stokes 
    
      (color / gray / dark etc.)
    
    - Accent: Warning, Danger, Success
    
      (color / accent / warning , color / accent / danger , color / accent / success)
      
      
  * Buttons
      
    - Primary buttons
    
      (button / primary / big etc.)
    
    - Outline buttons
      (button / outline / small etc.)
    
  * States
  
    - Hover state
    
      (state / hover)
      
    - Disabled state
    
      (state / disabled)
      
    - Pressed state
      
      (state / pressed)

   * Icons 
   
      (icon / icon-name)
      
      
   * Typography
   
      My base font is usually 16px and I multiply it to 1.414 to get its modular scale, then plot down all the font sizes on my artboard with the following text style names, and save each as shared style:
      
      - Display 1
      - Display 2
      - Display 3
      - Display 4
      - Headline
      - Title
      - Subheading
      - Body 2
      - Body 1
      - Button
      - Links

### Design style guide

I group my layers and rename the group with its composition name. Read [Design style guide](https://github.com/rielm/design-resources/blob/master/design-style-guide.md) to know more about my design style guide. 

### Initial run to Final run

Once I've laid out all my symbols, texts, and pages, I now create the final sketch document. I only get the symbols and styles which I have used in my initial run of designs and move it in my final run.

### Design polish

After doing the design final run, I do some polishing especially if my elements and components are following the 8x8 grid system. Checking my spacing, font sizes, and color consitency.
