## Rule of thumb 

* "A general good rule of thumb is 2-3 alphabets in length, or 52-78 characters (including spaces) per line. 
This is for legibility purposes."

* "The general rule of thumb in tracking your words (not the characters) is that the shorter the line length the tighter the tracking, the opposite is also true."

* For line height, multiply font size by 1.6 ratio, but for bigger font sizes (i.e. 64px) multiply it to 1.2 ratio
